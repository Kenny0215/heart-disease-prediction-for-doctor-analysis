## AI-DRIVEN HEART DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM

**Heart disease** is a major global health issue, causing millions of deaths annually due to late detection.
* The diagnosis often involves analyzing multiple medical tests, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
* A "Heart Disease Prediction System" was developed by the group to address these challenges.
* This AI-based system analyzes patient's medical data to predict the presence of heart disease.
* The objective is to provide doctors with a tool that enhances decision-making speed and accuracy. 

It utilizes three different classification algorithms, optimizes the best one using Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV), and provides an interactive command-line interface for real-time user predictions.

##  Features

*   **Automated Data Pipeline:** Automatically downloads the Heart Disease dataset using `kagglehub`.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Handles data splitting and feature scaling (Standardization).
*   **Multi-Model Training:** Trains and evaluates:
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Decision Tree
    *   Random Forest
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal settings for the Random Forest model to maximize accuracy.
*   **Visualization:** Generates a bar chart comparing model performance.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Exports a detailed `AI_Project_Result.txt` summarizing training statistics.
*   **Interactive Prediction:** A user-friendly CLI that allows you to input patient data and get a real-time risk assessment with confidence scores.

##  Installation
* **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIPM.git
cd AIPM
```
* **Install required dependencies:**
You need Python installed. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kagglehub`
 
## Usage
Run the main script to start the pipeline:
`python main.py`
What happens next?
  * Download: The app downloads the dataset.
  * Train: It trains the models and tunes the Random Forest.
  * Visualize: A graph (final_result_graph.png) is saved.
  * Report: A text report (AI_Project_Result.txt) is generated.
  * Predict: The app will ask:
  * Do you want to enter patient data for prediction using Random Forest? (y/n)
  * Type y to enter patient details step-by-step.

## Medical Attributes Used
The model requires 13 medical attributes for prediction:
* Age: Age in years.
* Sex: 1 = Male, 0 = Female.
* CP (Chest Pain Type): 0=Typical Angina, 1=Atypical, 2=Non-anginal, 3=Asymptomatic.
* Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
* Chol: Serum cholestoral (mg/dl).
* FBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1=True, 0=False).
* RestECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2).
* Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
* Exang: Exercise induced angina (1=Yes, 0=No).
* Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
* Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2).
* CA: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.
Thal: Thalassemia (0=Null, 1=Fixed Defect, 2=Normal, 3=Reversable Defect).
